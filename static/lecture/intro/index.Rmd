# Different ways to be "Big" 

## Volume 
## Variety 
## Velocity 

<!-- Each of these can break our hardware (disks/algorithms/networks), but that's relatively generic problem.
Particularly interested in how this breaks our _Science_, changes to the research process to that better address this.
That is: the management and analysis of massive data in the context global change research
Research that _scales_

# data visualization

> today the visualization and analysis component has become a bottleneck

--

- Visualization is time-consuming: becomes only an end-product

--

- Web visualizations increasingly interactive, directly tied to data

--

- Scientific visualization typically static images, divorced from data


<small> Fox & Hendler (2011) doi:[10.1126/science.1197654](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1197654) </small>



<!--

> A consequence of the major effort for visualization is that it becomes an end product of scientific analysis, rather than an exploration tool

> stop thinking of visualization as a necessary evil at the end of the scientific pipeline and use it as a tool in data comprehension.

> Many other data visualizations on the Web are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and interactive, while at the same time becoming easier to generate thanks to the prevalence of open Application Programming Interfaces ..

> Despite the increasing prevalence of these techniques on the Web, we are often looking at tables of numbers, best-fit curves, or other analytic results rather than being able to use visual means when we interact with the complex scientific data in many fields. Many of the visualization tools that are available to scientists do not allow live linking as do these Web-based tools. Once the visualization is created, it is no longer tied to the data ...

## Pedagogy


Some things in this course are in keeping with good / leading pedagogy

--

- We will start with graphs first
- active learning, flipped classroom
- peer instruction

--

Some things aren't

--

- Starting on the deep end
- We will start with untidy data
- unstructured training

## Language: Why R?

--
- Not about the technical attributes

--
- Pick your language based on what people in your area speak/code

--
- Python vs R: closely analogous feature set; lots of interesting differences to discuss over beer


---
class: inverse

## Why tidyverse?

--
- [tidyverse manifesto](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html)

--
- Consistent design, parallels tools in other languages (Python/pandas, SQL)

--
- Significant adoption in the data science community

--
- Pick your language based on what people in your area speak/code


---
class: inverse

## Why git?

--
- GitHub.com

--
- Pick your language based on what people in your area speak/code

--
- Very powerful but often convoluted syntax, see <http://stevelosh.com/blog/2013/04/git-koans/>

--
- Widely used == easier to get help
