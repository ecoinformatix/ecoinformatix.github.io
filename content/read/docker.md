- [Install Docker (Community Edition, free & open source) for your laptop](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition). (Mac, Windows, & Linux)

- Launch the Docker command line, and run: `docker pull rocker/r-base` to download the image we'll be using in class. If either of these steps do not work for you, don't worry, we should be able to fix any special cases in class.  


## Debugging Docker Install


### MacOS

Docker installation is pretty robust on MacOS now.  Very old Mac systems may need to use [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/) instead.


### Windows

Windows support has been evolving rapidly. If Docker Community Edition installation fails, try installing [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) instead. This adds another virtual layer, but is also better tested on a wide range of Windows machines.  


### Linux

See <https://docs.docker.com/install/>.  Docker is included in most package manangers as well.
