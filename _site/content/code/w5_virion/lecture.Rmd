## VERENA

The Viral Emergence Research Initiative (VERENA) is a global consortium. Our goal is to curate the largest ecosystem of open data in viral ecology, and build tools to help predict which viruses could infect humans, which animals host them, and where they could someday emerge.


[Learn more about the consortium here](https://www.viralemergence.org/)




## VIRION

With over 3 million records, the Global Virome in One Network (VIRION) database is a living encyclopedia of vertebrate viruses - including the ones that pose the greatest threats to human health. Data like these pave the way for a new era of predictive science, and form the backbone for a broader data ecosystem weâ€™re building for animal disease surveillance.





## Exploring the Virion data


Download the Virion data from the link below:

>  https://github.com/viralemergence/virion/tree/main/Virion


There are many different bits of information, including detection information (how was the host-virus association quantified?), taxonomic information on hosts and viruses, and the host-virus association data. Let's load the entire dataset and get a better idea of the scope and nature of the data

> https://github.com/viralemergence/virion/blob/main/Virion/Virion.csv.gz

is where the data lives. It is compressed to avoid file size limitation on GitHub, but can be efficiently read into R using the `vroom` package.




```{r}

install.packages('vroom'), repos='https://cloud.r-project.org')
library(vroom)

virion <- vroom::vroom('data/Virion.csv.gz')


# make an interaction matrix
virionInt <- table(virion$Host, virion$Virus)


dim(virionInt)

# how host-specific are viruses?
hist(colSums(virionInt>0), 
  col='dodgerblue', breaks=100, 
  main='')
abline(v=mean(colSums(virionInt>0)), lwd=2, col='grey')

# on average, viruses infect around 2 species
mean(colSums(virionInt>0))


# but this one infects over x species
which.max(colSums(virionInt[,-1] > 0))

```

This is the sort of exploratory data analysis that researchers do to try to understand the data. It can also be used to generate research questions. Why is influenza a virus so common in the data relative to the majority of other pathogens? How do patterns of host-virus associations change across different host groups (i.e., are there some pathogens that only infect certain groups of host species?). Tons of fun questions. Let us now do some string manipulation and continue learning about R. 











## String manipulation in base R

First, we can make pull in some characters to manipulate. 

```{r}

vonn <- c('Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt')

# mess with case
tolower(vonn)
toupper(vonn)


# get the first word in the string
substr(vonn, 1, 10)


# get the last word in the string
nchar(vonn)
substr(vonn, nchar(vonn)-3, nchar(vonn))

# ((substring is like substr, but with no end))
substring(vonn, first=nchar(vonn)-3)


# replace single characters 
chartr('e', 'a', vonn)
chartr('et', 'ad', vonn)

# replace entire sets of characters
gsub("Everything", "Nothing", vonn)
gsub(".", "Nothing", vonn)


```



But this all assumes that we are working with a vector of length 1 basically, right? A lot of times, when we work with characters, we will be working with longer vectors.




```{r}

vonn2 <- strsplit(vonn, ' ')

## what is the structure of vonn2?
str(vonn2)

vonn2 <- unlist(vonn2)

## but what if we want to paste it back together? 
paste(vonn2, collapse=' ')

## paste is also really useful for appending or combining character strings with different properties

paste(vonn2, LETTERS[1:length(vonn2)], sep='-')



## but let's get back to vectors of characters instead of just whole sentences as strings
vonn2 

## plenty of existing functionality is vectorized to work not just on a single string, but on character vectors

nchar(vonn)
nchar(vonn2)

tolower(vonn)
tolower(vonn2)


startsWith(vonn2, 'b')
endsWith(vonn2, 'g')


grepl("hurt", vonn2)
grep("hurt", vonn2)

```







## String manipulation in the tidyverse


```{r}

install.packages('stringr'), repos='https://cloud.r-project.org')
library(stringr)

paste(vonn2, collapse=' ') == stringr::str_c(vonn2, collapse = ' ')


substr(vonn2, 1, 3) == stringr::str_sub(vonn2, 1, 3)

str_to_upper(vonn3)==toupper(vonn3)

str_to_upper(vonn3, locale='tr')

str_detect(vonn3, 'hurt') 

str_detect(vonn3, '[0-9]')

str_count(vonn3, 'u')

str_locate(vonn3, 'ur')

str_replace(vonn3, 'Everything', 'nothing')

```


















### VIRION 


How many records exist for host species of the genus 'Abramis'?
 
```{r}




```










How many unique pathogen species in the data have the word 'virus' in them?

```{r}



```











How many host-virus records are from GenBank? 

```{r}


```










How many host-virus records have a reference text that is a website?

```{r}




```

```{r}



```










How many times does the character string 'ad' appear in the `VirusFamily` column?

Tie back into plotting. Maybe plot out parasite species richness across host species or something like that if time is available?

```{r}



```
